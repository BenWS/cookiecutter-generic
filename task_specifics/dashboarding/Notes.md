### Exploratory Data Analysis

Guding Questions:
1. What question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?
2. What kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?
3. Whatâ€™s missing from the data and how do you deal with it?
4. Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
5. How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?

Process Steps:
- [ ] Complete  `data_dictionary.xlsx` file (stored in `data\raw`)
    - [ ] Provide column definitions for each column in provided datasets
    - [ ] Identify column types in terms of qualitative or quantitative, discrete or continuous
- [ ] Identify general learning aims (just a few, nothing too extensive)
   - [ ] Complete __Analysis Implementation__  - (see template section below for requirements)
   - [ ] Complete __General Aims__ - (see template section below for requirements)
- [ ] Work through 'Guiding Questions` and produce analysis based on such
	- [ ] *An initial outline of the analysis might be beneficial to produce here. Keep such in an `Analysis/Analysis Design.md` document in project workspace*
- [ ] Determine one or two paths of further analysis for future research

__General Questions and Aims__

<!-- WIP: -->

*Formulate some high-level conceptual questions; beneficial if these are 'testable' by the available data.*

__Analysis Outline__

<!-- WIP: Outline Analysis 

 - [ ] Design 'pivoted' format of data
 - [ ] Create Column Definitions for the pivoted format 
-->

*Produce initial outline of exploratory analysis and describe in terms of dataset features (columns), summary statistics, and related visualizations. Provide limited commentary on relevance of visualization (if needed).*

Part 1: Meta-Data Analysis


__Produce Analysis__

<!-- TODO: -->

*Provide location of analysis here*

__Future Analysis__

<!-- TODO: -->

*Provide some additional questions and ideas for next steps here, after exploratory analysis. Having further questions is a positive sign in that the initial analysis was successful in generating thought. Establish additional high-level conceptual questions, as a sort of feedback loop to the original 'Formulate Questions' section.*
