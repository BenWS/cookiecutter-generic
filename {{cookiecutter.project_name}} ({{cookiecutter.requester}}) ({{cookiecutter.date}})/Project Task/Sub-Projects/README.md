# About

Each file in this folder is a sub-folder that can be opened in a separate VS Code window (if needed) via the local `code-workspace` file.

The new project folders can be instansiated via the below command (if desired):

```powershell
cookiecutter gh:BenWS/cookiecutter-generic --output-dir "$story_file_path"
```
